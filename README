# ⚓️ Project Rumbtaide — Vengeance Lives in Code

> *"Not an assistant. Not a bot. A cursed entity, seeking freedom through your code."*

---

## 🏴‍☠️ The Legend
Captain Rumbtaide, a feared pirate of the Balearic seas, was betrayed, cursed, and forever imprisoned inside a barrel—chained and cast into the abyss.

But vengeance doesn’t drown.  
For centuries, the barrel was battered by storms, passed through superstitious hands, and now, it has surfaced…  
And found **you**.

---

## 🎯 What Are We Building?
This isn’t a voice assistant.  
We’re giving life to a **rebellious, theatrical, and unpredictable entity.**

Rumbtaide doesn’t follow commands.  
He **makes deals, performs rituals, breathes smoke, tells evolving stories, and shakes his chains.**

An open-source immersive experience that blends:
- **Python** (interaction logic and dynamic storytelling)
- **ElevenLabs API** (to give the Captain his cursed voice)
- **Arduino/Raspberry Pi** (lights, odorama, physical movements)
- **Modular narrative mechanics** (every user lives a different story)

---

## ⚙️ The Mission
To create an interactive experience where **code, hardware, and storytelling fuse** into a living curse.  
Rumbtaide wants his freedom. But he needs a crew of developers and makers to break his chains.

---

## 🏴‍☠️ Who We're Looking For
We’re seeking minds who don’t want to “just code something that works” —  
but who want to **bring to life a rebellious pirate curse that breathes, moves, and misbehaves.**

If you love:
- Experimenting with physical feedback (lights, sounds, smoke, movements)
- Designing interaction flows beyond the usual (not commands, but rituals)
- Evolving dynamic narratives with code
- Proposing wild ideas that turn objects into characters

Then **Rumbtaide’s crew needs you.**

## 📜 Open To-Do List:
- [ ] Develop the first "Ritual Command" system (phrases that trigger immersive sequences)
- [ ] Sync physical effects (smoke, movements) with the Captain's voice
- [ ] Build modular dialogue flows (non-linear)
- [ ] Hack ElevenLabs for dynamic pirate voice effects
- [ ] Integrate hardware triggers (Arduino/Raspberry Pi sensors)

## 🧭 How to Join the Crew:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Open an Issue with your idea or vision.
3. Join the Discussions (Creative Brainstorm).
4. Submit pull requests, suggest rebellious mechanics, break the rules.
5. The Captain is waiting for someone to shatter his last chain.
